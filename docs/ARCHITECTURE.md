# PokePlanner Architecture

## Overview

PokePlanner is a Rust workspace organized into a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system exposes both REST and gRPC APIs, backed by a shared service layer and pluggable storage. It integrates with [PokeAPI v2](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) to discover pokemon per game and compute optimal team compositions.

## Data Flow

1. **Request** enters via REST, gRPC, or CLI
2. **API layer** deserializes and validates input, then delegates to the service
3. **Service** orchestrates business logic — fetching pokemon, filtering, planning teams
4. **PokeAPI Client** handles external HTTP calls with rate limiting and disk caching
5. **Storage** persists job state (currently JSON files, interface supports future SQL/NoSQL)
6. **Response** flows back up through the layers

## Job System

The job system supports long-running operations:
1. Client submits a job via `POST /jobs` (REST) or `SubmitJob`/`PlanTeam` (gRPC) or CLI
2. Service creates a `Pending` job with a `JobKind` (Generic or TeamPlan), persists it, and returns the job ID immediately
3. A background task picks up the job, transitions it through `Running` -> `Completed`/`Failed`
4. Job `progress` field is updated during long operations (e.g., "Fetching pokemon 47/312")
5. Client polls for status via `GET /jobs/{id}` or `GetJob` or CLI `get-job`

## Team Planning Flow

1. User selects a source: game (version-group), pokedex, or custom pokemon list
2. Service fetches candidate pokemon via PokeAPI (cached aggressively, 1-year TTL)
3. Optional BST filter reduces candidates
4. **Hybrid algorithm** selects optimal teams:
   - N ≤ 25: exact brute-force (provably optimal)
   - N > 25: greedy beam search (beam width 50, high-quality heuristic)
5. Score function: 40% offensive type coverage + 30% defensive score + 30% normalized BST
6. Returns top-K teams with type coverage analysis

## PokeAPI Navigation Chain

```
version-group/{name} → pokedexes[]
pokedex/{name} → pokemon_entries[] (species names)
pokemon-species/{name} → varieties[] (forms: base, mega, regional)
pokemon/{form_name} → stats[], types[]
```

## Caching Strategy

Two layers of caching in `data/cache/`:
- **Raw API responses**: `pokemon/`, `species/`, `pokedex/`, `version-group/`, `type/` — individual JSON files per resource
- **Aggregated results**: `game-pokemon/`, `type-chart/` — pre-computed for fast repeated access

All caches use 1-year TTL. Bypassed via `--no-cache` (CLI), `?no_cache=true` (REST), or `no_cache: true` (gRPC).

## Rate Limiting

PokeAPI is a free, no-auth public API. We are responsible consumers:

- **Default rate: 20 requests/second** with a burst allowance of 5. This is conservative — PokeAPI does not publish a hard limit, but sits behind Cloudflare which can throttle or block aggressive clients.
- **Configurable** via `PokeApiClientConfig` — binaries can adjust `requests_per_second` and `burst_size`.
- **Single shared rate limiter**: All concurrent jobs and API handlers share one `Arc<PokeApiHttpClient>`, so the rate limit is global per process, not per-request or per-job. Two concurrent jobs each get roughly half the budget.
- **Concurrency cap**: Mass-fetch operations use `BufferedUnordered(10)` — at most 10 HTTP requests in flight at once per fetch operation. Combined with the rate limiter, this prevents connection storms.
- **Aggressive caching eliminates repeat calls**: After the first cold-cache fetch, all subsequent requests for the same data are served from disk. The rate limiter only matters for cold-cache scenarios.

### Expected cold-cache times (national dex, 1028 species)

| Scenario | Requests | Time at 20 req/s |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Default forms only | ~2,057 | ~1.7 minutes |
| With mega/regional variants | ~2,430 | ~2 minutes |
| With movesets (future) | ~4,400 | ~3.5 minutes |

These are one-time costs. Subsequent calls are instant from cache.
